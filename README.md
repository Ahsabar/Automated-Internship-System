# Internship Automation System
This project automates the internship application process, originally developed in Node.js and now re-implemented using ASP.NET Core. The system provides functionalities for students, companies, and administrators to manage internship workflows efficiently.

The current implementation is a work-in-progress, featuring a monolithic architecture and representing a small subset of the original system. Some methods are incomplete or duplicated intentionally as the project is under development, with plans to transition into a microservices-based architecture in the future.

# Features
Internship Applications: Students can apply to opportunities, submit the necessary files and track their internship progress. <br />
Company Management: Companies can manage applications and provide feedback. <br />
Admin Tools: Administrators can monitor and manage the overall internship process.

# Current Status
The project is still in development, with some methods and functionalities pending completion. <br />
Duplicate methods exist temporarily as part of the ongoing development process. <br />
Plans to refactor and expand the system into a microservices architecture are underway.

# Technology Stack
Frontend: To be integrated in a later stage with React. <br />
Backend: ASP.NET Core <br />
